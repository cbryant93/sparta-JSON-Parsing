# sparta-JSON-Parsing
Create a new Github repo called Sparta-JSON-Parsing and go through the steps from class to parse through a JSON document of your creation into a Ruby class and write at least 5 tests. I would recommend using the Mockaroo JSON generator. The JSON file should have at least 1 nested object and one nested array.
